âœ³ What is a Cluster?

 ğŸ‘‰ A cluster is a group of interconnected computers that work together as a single system to perform tasks or run applications. These computers, or nodes, are usually connected through a network and can communicate with each other to share resources and distribute workloads.

ğŸ‘‰ It consists of a master/driver node and a group of worker nodes.

ğŸ“Œ Master Node: The driver/master node is responsible for coordinating the workers and their parallel execution of tasks.

ğŸ“Œ Worker Node: The worker node is responsible for the completion of the tasks allocated.



âœ³ Types of clusters available in Databricks

ğŸ‘‰ Single Node

ğŸ‘‰ Multi-Node

ğŸ“Œ In a single-node cluster, there will no workers, and the spark jobs will run in the same node.



âœ³ What is a Delta Lake?

ğŸ‘‰ Delta Lake is an open-source storage framework that brings reliability to data lakes.

ğŸ“Œ Whenever a delta lake table is created in databricks cluster, a transactional log file will be added.



âœ³ What is a transactional log of Delta Lake?

ğŸ‘‰ It is an ordered collection of every transaction performed on the table.

ğŸ‘‰ It acts as a single source of truth



âœ³ What are the advantages of Delta Lake?

ğŸ‘‰ Brings ACID properties to the object storage

ğŸ‘‰ Handles the scalable metadata

ğŸ‘‰ Full audit trail of all changes

ğŸ‘‰ Builds upon standard data formats: Paraquet + JSON



ğŸ“Œ ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

ğŸ“Œ Atomicity means that all transactions either succeed or fail completely.

ğŸ“Œ Consistency guarantees relate to how a given state of the data is observed by simultaneous operations.

ğŸ“Œ Isolation refers to how simultaneous operations potentially conflict with one another.

ğŸ“Œ Durability means that committed changes are permanent.
